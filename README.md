## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 15+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS Account
- Stripe Account
- iOS device or simulator

### iOS App Setup

1. Open the Xcode project:
```bash
cd TitanMart
open TitanMart.xcodeproj
```

2. Build and run the app in Xcode (Cmd + R)

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

3. Run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Deploy to AWS:
```bash
npm install -g serverless
serverless deploy
```

See [backend/aws-setup.md](backend/aws-setup.md) for detailed AWS setup instructions.

## Development Workflow

### Current Status

The iOS app is fully functional with:
- ✅ User authentication (Login/Signup with CSUF email)
- ✅ Product browsing and search
- ✅ Shopping cart
- ✅ Checkout flow
- ✅ User profiles and orders
- ✅ Mock data for testing

The backend includes:
- ✅ RESTful API structure
- ✅ Authentication endpoints
- ✅ Product, order, and review endpoints
- ✅ Stripe payment integration
- ✅ AWS deployment configuration

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**: Set up AWS infrastructure
2. **Connect iOS to Backend**: Update API endpoint in iOS app
3. **Implement Reviews**: Complete rating/review UI
4. **Add Image Upload**: Implement S3 image upload for products
5. **Security Hardening**: Implement WAF rules and security monitoring
6. **Testing**: End-to-end testing with real data

## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- CSUF email verification required
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Payment Security
- Stripe integration with escrow-style payments
- PCI compliance through Stripe
- Payment held until buyer confirms receipt

### Cloud Security
- IAM roles with least privilege
- DynamoDB encryption at rest
- API Gateway with request validation
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
- WAF rules for common threats

### Data Protection
- All API calls over HTTPS
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (NoSQL)
- XSS protection

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify CSUF email

### Products
